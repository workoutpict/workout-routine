<p>You can even make this at home using 2 cups of water and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt. This is a good idea if you work with individuals who are at greater risk of developing complications from certain illnesses. Yoga poses and breathing exercises are particularly good for sinus issues because they can relax the body and mind, which improves breathing and circulation and helps the body heal. I recommend starting this early on in the course of the illness to prevent the infection from worsening. Pin on Turquoise.</p>
