<p><strong>Why Take Amino Acids Before Workout</strong>, The time immediately following exercise is ideal for triggering muscle synthesis, preventing muscle damage, and starting the recovery process. If you are getting a variety of essential amino acids from a proper diet and you exercise regularly, then it is very likely that your body is producing the right amount of amino acids for your needs as well. People looking to improve exercise performance and therefore, reduce the breakdown of protein and muscle during an intense workout might also take amino acid supplementation. However, in times of stress, illness, or injury, your body may need some assistance.</p>

<p>An amino acid dietary supplement helps you quickly get enough amino acids to fuel your activities, whether that’s an intense workout or simply maximizing your day — without breaking down your muscle or adding extra calories. Build energy supply bcaa intake prior to a workout will prime the body to provide sufficient energy for a more intense workout. People looking to improve exercise performance and therefore, reduce the breakdown of protein and muscle during an intense workout might also take amino acid supplementation. When you train or compete your body breaks down protein at a rate that can lead to a negative protein balance and a catabolic (muscle wasting) state. Both categories of amino acids play a vital role in supporting a healthy body and exercise endurance.</p>
