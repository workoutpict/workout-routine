<p><strong>P90x Insanity Hybrid Workout Results</strong>, This workout schedule is a widely used p if you are doing home fitness program by beachbody then you must be looking for hybrid schedules through which you can pack in the goodness of two great workouts into one schedule to get advanced results of. I decided that i’m going to do a p90x insanity hybrid. P90x “as is” will give you a great foundation, but the cardio while challenging, is not intense as insanity, so you can build up your cardio to prepare for insanity or this hybrid. The results are not as impressive as when i finished the first round of p90x.</p>

<p>So why the insanity / p90x hybrid. Combining p90x, insanity and revabs in a different way than before. That�d depend on what specific hybrid routine you select and what your goals are (fat loss, increased stamina, bulk, etc). I’d carry that same substitution through the 3rd month.</p>

<p>For month 2, i’d keep the day 1 and 3 lift days the same, but i’d substitute the insanity upper body lifting for day 5 (as a sub for legs and back). My results from round 1 were excellent, however, i was not ripped. First, i’d keep the month 1 p90x lift days the exact same. However, it was expected since i was already in a somewhat decent shape when i started the hybrid program. The next 30 days will consist of p90x and insanity (my original hybrid).</p>

<p>If you have only the base insanity package, you won’t have the upper body lift. Looking through this i decided that this is the workout that i’m going to do. I have finished a full round of insanity a few years back and got about a month into p90x and occasionally will do a week or two of p90x. After this round, my weight dropped from 135 lbs to 125 lbs and my waist dropped from 29.5 to 28. Pin on Fitness.</p>

<p>For month 2, i’d keep the day 1 and 3 lift days the same, but i’d substitute the insanity upper body lifting for day 5 (as a sub for legs and back). Next get on shakeology and drink it everyday, it can and will help you get through the workouts themselves and increase your overall results. Free shakeology sample (six days worth). If you have only the base insanity package, you won’t have the upper body lift. InsanityP90X Hybrid Insanity workout schedule, Insanity.</p>
