<p>Everything is the same other than those two ingredients. Woke af, gorilla mode, bamf, total war are solid choices if you�re looking for relatively high stims/good pump. My friend told me today that he has heard of people taking woke af by das labs and failing a drug test (ua). My drug test is in 2 to 3 days. Total war just doesn’t do much it’s all fake reviews and marketing they even have their own pyramid scheme now with the tier system lol.</p>
