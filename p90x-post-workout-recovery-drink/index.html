<p>The product comes in powder form which you simply mix with water. However, i ultimately decided to stick with the p90x results and recovery formula. It mixes up very well (i use a shaker cup) and the texture isn’t thick like a shake — it’s definitely more like a refreshing drink. These added ingredients do provide additional benefits when it comes to faster recovery and are likely why the p90x recovery drink is priced the way it is.
