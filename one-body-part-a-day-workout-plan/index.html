<p>With other types of workouts, you might have an upper body day, or chest day, or arm day, or leg day, or back and biceps day, or push day, or something similar. A full body workout routine is a strength training program built around training most or all of the entire body during each workout rather than splitting it up into different parts. Ultimately, having a strong grasp on your weekly workout routine so that you’re working on all muscle groups and body parts will prevent injury and keep your body at its healthiest. This means that each muscle group gets trained just once every 7th day, which makes this a pretty low frequency form of weight training. The Foolproof Workout Plan For Toning Your Lower Body In.</p>
