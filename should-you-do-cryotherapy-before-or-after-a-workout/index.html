<p>With option 2, cryotherapy after a workout, the decreased inflammation experienced by your body would allow you to more quickly recover from exercise. For best results following a cryo session, do not eat sugar 2 hours before and after the session. You can work out before a cryotherapy session to ease sore muscles. Blood flow changes were measured with ceu at baseline, immediately after exercise, and 48 hours after exercise. Should You Have a Protein Shake Before or After Your Workout?.</p>
