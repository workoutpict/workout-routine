<p>Grenade gives excellent energy boost and heat effect during workout but one must take in consideration to have proper nutrition and tons of water as well since metabolism is boosted. The main ingredients included in grenade supplements are green tea, bitter orange powder, caffeine anhydrous, cayenne and green coffee. However, this was made up by the amazing pump and crazy intensity that was given to me throughout my workouts!! Grenade.50 calibre review by suppjunky, november 2, 2013.</p>

<p>Grenade advises that you take six at4 capsules per day, either in one go first thing in the morning, or in two doses at least half an hour prior to breakfast and lunch. Carb killa bars weren�t as good as everyone made out to be, tried the thermo detonator pills and left me with a burning sensation down my throat and in my stomach, berry blast pre workout was one of the worst things i�ve tasted and the bcaa tropical flavour tastes alright but has left a itchy tingling feel all over my body, best thing in the care package box is the shaker and the choc. We’d say that as long as it fits your budget and meets your expectations in terms of features/spec…it’s a really strong contender. I hope this video helped you guys out.

Be very careful when you take this, although the two servings are at different times in the day, we still think it’s likely that you could experience side effects from using it.
