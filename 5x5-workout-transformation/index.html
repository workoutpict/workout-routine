<p>The program has two workouts, workout a and workout b, which are done in an alternate manner. Sl 5x5 uses compound lifts. By using a 5x5 routine, i was able to add more strength than at any time in my life. You can start this program doing 5x5, but you will need to switch to 3x5 soon enough as 5x5 is going to become too much. Contact Me From fat to fit.</p>
