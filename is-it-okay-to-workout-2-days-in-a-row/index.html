<p>If i do need to train chest more than once per week it would be a full chest workout on monday, and light chest with tri�s and bi�s on friday. Because your body is still unaccustomed to stressing the same muscle groups within 24 hours of the previous session, expect a slight dip in performance the first couple of times you lift on consecutive days. For example, strength training two days in a row wouldn�t be such a good idea as your muscles need time to recover and rebuild. It’s perfectly fine to train the same muscle group or perform the same exercise (s) multiple days in a row. Does Asphalt Seal Coating Work? [Is It Important?].</p>

<p>Good question, though, i was guilty of doing the same thing in the past, and for the same reasons as you. This isn�t something you could do indefinitely, but the study did cover 8 weeks with no issues other than the 1st week where your body is adapting to the same movements 2 days in a row. Muscles require at least 48 hours of rest in between workouts. It’s perfectly fine to train the same muscle group or perform the same exercise(s) multiple days in a row. It�s Okay to Not Be Okay.</p>
