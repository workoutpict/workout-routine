<p><strong>Post Workout Meal Keto</strong>, Just water and some tea in the 6 hours between lunch and our workout. Btw, on days where you are working out, you can add a little more protein to your meals, it will not kick you out of ketosis. Or is the point of keto to have protein/fat for every meal, every day, except for one high carb cheat meal a week? I�m confused on what to have pre/post workout.</p>
