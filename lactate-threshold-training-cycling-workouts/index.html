<p><strong>Lactate Threshold Training Cycling Workouts</strong>, The term “threshold” is generally synonymous with other common exercise physiology terms like lactate threshold (lt), anaerobic threshold (at), and maximal lactate steady state (mlss) [1]. Working on the lactate threshold is especially important for cyclists focusing on shorter races where it is important to sustain high intensity for extended periods of time. 2×20 or 3×20 in zone 4.
