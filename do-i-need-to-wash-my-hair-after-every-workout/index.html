<p>Don’t wash your hair every time So for me, i usually alternate cardio (running) days with strength training circuit days and i wash my hair after runs, because generally those get my hair the sweatiest. Do brush your hair after a workout brushing your hair after working out (while it�s still sweaty) can help to prevent the sweat from remaining clogged at your roots and scalp. If you exercise and sweat heavily, you might wonder if you should always wash your hair afterwards. Nuskhe Admin 5 Expert Hair Care Tips For Men 5 Expert Hair.</p>
