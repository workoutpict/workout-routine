<p>Both weight training and body building can sometimes lead to red stretch marks from muscles that grow much bigger in a short period of time. So i�ve been lifting seriously since march of this year and i�m just starting to slip out of that magical newbie zone where i can lose lots of weight while gaining muscle with a four day lifting routine and clean eating. As with all scars, they are red to purple in color early on, and they generally do fade to a more pale color over time. I�m thinking it�s just the bar somehow leaving a mark on my shoulders, sometimes lasting a few days? What Are the Red Marks On My Shoulders and Traps After I.</p>
