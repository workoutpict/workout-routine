<p>So, in summary, no, eating whey protein without exercising isn’t dangerous. Mass gainers contain little levels of proteins which refills the used protein, in turn, preventing a negative protein balance. Whey protein also contains a full amino acid profile for muscle building, which is why it is the most popular protein supplement. You can get enough protein from a real food diet, and downing a protein shake right after you drop the barbell isn’t going to make much difference, if any. Point is that body can�t store proteins, but can convert them into carbs which then can be stored as fat.</p>
