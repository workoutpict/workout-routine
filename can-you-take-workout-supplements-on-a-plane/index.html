<p>Can i take medicine on a plane in a cabin bag? There�s a limit of 17 fluid ounces per container for medicinal and toiletry articles,. If you�re travelling for 3 hours of more by plane, train or car, take these steps during the journey to reduce your risk of dvt: If you prefer to use one anyway, be conscientious about its ingredients and your total intake. Theres countless supplements out there that you can take.</p>
