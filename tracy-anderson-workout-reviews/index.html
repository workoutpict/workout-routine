<p>I desperately looked for something, anything that i could do to workout. Even though anderson has an exercise empire, she stresses the importance of a healthy diet. I highly recommend the tracy anderson method to any woman who wants to slim down, tone up, and achieve a feminine look or a dancer inspired body. However, as the years went on, i became obsessed with other workouts, like boxing and hiit, and my ta devotion waned. It combines muscular toning exercises with dance cardio.</p>
