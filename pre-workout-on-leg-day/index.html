<p>Push yourself harder mentally and physically! One leg goes behind you on the bench, with the toes facing down so that the ankle can move freely and the other planted in front, with the foot tight on the floor. This movement trains unilateral (one side) strength and stability and is extremely effective for any lower body warmup! Both a dynamic stretch and an activation exercise for the legs. Nutrabio leg day is an awesome intra workout supplement for serious athletes who want the most out of their workouts.</p>
