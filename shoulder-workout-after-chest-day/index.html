For the movement, lower your body until your chest is just about to touch the floor, and then push yourself up and repeat.</p>

<p>Your anterior delts that are found in the shoulders assist in any movements involving the chest while your triceps are used for any overhead pressing motions. Although you are not directly training your chest on shoulder day, your shoulders will come into play during compound exercises such as the bench press or dumbbell press and especially in incline bench press exercises. Finish final day with shoulders and short tricep workout (they were worked on chest day also). So i don�t know whats going on, but it seems like my shoulders get more of a workout than my chest on chest day. Perhaps a back, chest, rest, legs, arms, rest, shoulders, rest would allow for adequate rest/recovery to really hammer shoulders if you feel they are lagging.</p>
